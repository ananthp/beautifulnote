Great composers, Great musicians, Flute, Syama Sastry.

Some contemporary theorists contradict Sambamurthy's stance on 22 shrutis (Arvindh Krishnaswamy, Madhumohan Komaragiri)

His contribution to Carnatic music very valuable.

In 2001, Jayashri, along with Sanjay Subrahmanyan and T. M. Krishna wrote the book 'Prof. Sambamoorthy, the visionary musicologist', detailing the life and times of Prof.Sambamoorthy â€“ eminent Indian musicologist. The book was published to commemorate his birth centenary.

High quality writing. Technical. Knowledge in various systems.

Bit defensive. Always comparative. (So were other musicologiest in british raj era)

14th Feb is Musicologist Professor P. Sambamurthy's birthday. I started reading his treatise, *South Indian Music, 6 volumes*, when I got more than slightly interested in Carnatic music. I can't say I liked it very much at first. But I knew it was a very important resource and kept coming back to it often.

At first, it didn't feel like a crisp, concise theory book. I thought it had a lot of fluff and unnecessary boasting (about the system of music). I began appreciating the quality of the contents only after reading a few more *theory* books. Some of them had passages literally copied from Sambamoorthy's, while others didn't have much of theoretical value, IMHO (The ones that begin like *Carnatic music originated from Shiva's head*)

In Sambamurthy's writings, here and there I miss the neutral tone of a musician explaining a fellow musician or student certain aspects of *Music!* Instead there was a hint of an argument, a bit of defensiveness, as if the author is trying to prove someone, possibly an outsider, that *our* system of music is no inferior than *theirs*. This argument leads to comparisons everywhere, so instead of clarifying *Subject A is this*, we come across *Subject A here in South Indian Music is way better than the same Subject A in Western music*. Why does he do that?

May be because India was still under British rule when he was born and grew up, probably he really had to get into some arguments. Looks like he learnt Western flute in Europe. That further confirms my doubt.

Actually the comparative attitude in Karnatic music related texts was quite common since well before Sambamurthy's time. A.M. Chinnaswamy Mudaliyar's *Oriental Music in European Notation* (published in 1893) had a chapter titled **Why Do Europeans Dislike Oriental Music**

One shouldn't think I'm underestimating Prof. Sambamurthy's contribution. Actually I admire his passion for Carnatic music. His texts on music theory have become standard references to both beginners and pros, his biographies of composers and performers with rare pictures are treasures. He loved carnatic music and had a positive attitude towards it. 

I know very little about this great man. The only photograph printed in one of his books is very shady. He has received Padma Bhushan in 1971, the entry says *Pich Sambamurthy*, and there's no Wikipedia article on him yet. I'm creating one. Do contribute facts and improve the page.
