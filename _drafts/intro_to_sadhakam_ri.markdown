* image: Sa -> Ri1 -> Ri2 -> Ri3
* Ri1, right above sa, used in ragams like Mayamalavagowla, Saveri

* Ri3, one more step further. Farthest Ri from Sa. Ragam nata. (You'll not hear this Ri in concerts as often as you do the other two.) 
* Audio demo: (Observe how close/far each varient feels wrt Sa)
    * (in sadhakam default kattai?, or 6 kattai--common to both women and men)
    * Sa-Ri1
    * Sa-Ri2
    * Sa-Ri3

* Sadhakam Exercises:
    * Sa-Ri
    * Ri-Sa

* By repeatedly practicing these exercises, you'll gain the ability to instantly recognize Ri when you hear it, and be able to tell whether it is Ri1 or 2 or 3.

Tips:
* **Practice repeatedly**. Multiple times a day, for a few days. Then, move to next exercise, but still come back and revise often, until you are so familiar with each swarasthanam and do the exercise without thinking. With enough practice, the moment you hear the sequence, you'll already know the answer.
* **Sing the sequence before answering**. Sing as "Sa Ri" after hearing the quiz sequence in the same pitches. This way you'll also train your voice to sing and distinguish these swarasthanams. You'll understand the difference between them better, and learn faster.
* Feel free to replay the question before answering. Especially useful if you are also singing the sequence. This way you can be sure that you got the question sequence right, able to sing it correctly before proceeding to answer.
* **Don't be afraid to make mistakes**. Even after replaying the sequence and singing along, if you are not able to decide which swarasthanam it is, it simply means you need more practice. Just answer randomly without worrying about the score. But do observe the answer that the app shows and try to remember it.
