Keep this para short
* The word shruti has many different meanings/usages in carnatic music. All related though. Causes some confusion: see wikipedia page.
* Somehow there's difficulty simply calling it as a musical pitch. Authors fumble with _minute_ etc. Damn it man, it's just a pitch.
* Next confusion: How many pitches are there? 12? 16? 22? 24? 
* What are their relative ratios?

+ Compositions don't have keys (they do have scales though; ragas). Transposed all the time.
+ Ragas don't have key (precise musical pitch to be taken as tonic)

+ we have a fluid system. We can take any frequency as Sa and work with it.
* There are no standard reference freq.
* We resort to 'kattai'

440 hz? = A, -> C = 1 kattai?

make sure they know I'm not complaining.

* 12 basic tones of carnatic music
* madras music journal references
* my quora post
