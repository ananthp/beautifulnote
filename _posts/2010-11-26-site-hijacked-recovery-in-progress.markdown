<p>Site Restored. descard this message.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Beautifulnote.com has been hijacked. Probably due to a vulnerability in Wordpress.<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">When someone enters beauitulnote.com or beautifulnote.com&#47;blog it directs to the hackers site. However, if we use the url of any particular post (ex. this post) we can enter the actual beautifulnote.com and access other posts, downloads and music.<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I'm trying to restore the site by doing a fresh the wordpress installation and cleaning up themes and plugins etc. Meanwhile, please use this page as the starting point.<&#47;span></p>
