<p>Another score graduated from  my <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;ananthp&#47;carnatic_scores">Carnatic Scores Repository<&#47;a> - Saint Tyagaraja's kriti <em>Brochevarevare<&#47;em> in Sriranjani Ragam, Adi Talam</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Carnatic Scores Repository is my attempt to notate and share carnatic music compositions, to make them available to every musician and student. At present there is a handful of Varnams and Kritis which are in progress. (They too can be downloaded as they are, if you wish)</p>

From here: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;imslp.org&#47;wiki&#47;Brochevarevare_%28Ty%C4%81gar%C4%81ja%29">International Music Scores Library Project: Brochevarevare (Tyagaraja)<&#47;a><br />
or here: <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;ananthp&#47;carnatic_scores">Carnatic Scores Repository<&#47;a></p>
<p>A copy of completed scores will be uploaded to IMSLP, which is a good place for music scores. This page will list all such scores: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;imslp.org&#47;wiki&#47;Category:Pattabiraman,_Ananth">http:&#47;&#47;imslp.org&#47;wiki&#47;Category:Pattabiraman,_Ananth<&#47;a></p>
