Hi, my name is Ananth and I'm a music composer.

**BeautifulNote.com**'s mission to create and promote beautiful music. I believe music can dissolve geographical and cultural boundaries.

Here you can -

- **Listen to and Download** Creative Commons Licensed music for free
- Buy Affordable, High Quality **Royalty Free background scores**
- **Get music composed** for your Films, Documentaries, Ads, Videos.  

This is also the place for musicians to interact and make music together. The blog will explore the mysteries of music and technology, and often will try to come up with pragmatic ways to make music.
