  content: ! 'Murali Pavithran anna,


    I''ve heard about you. Peri mentioned your name when he spoke to me about his
    predominant students.


    For the Theory part --

    Sorry, there''s no proper book in English (official&#47;unofficial) that covers
    the syllabus. Potti Sriramulu Telugu University issues a text book in Telugu.
    Prof. Sambamurthy''s South Indian Music series covers almost everything, but one
    should know what''s in the syllabus first.


    Practicals:

    Akella Mallikarjuna Sharma''s Sangitha Vidya Bodhini is the syllabus. There''s
    an English version now, and should be available from Music Cabin (Sec''bad), Chords&#47;Music
    Palace (SD Road).'
