Note: <i>It's from a copy of official syllabus, scanned & reformatted, however, I can't make any promises that this is the current and official syllabus. Shared in public interest.</i>

### Notes:

* I've completed my certificate course. I used a different strategy for my notes for year 3 and 4; I couldn't share the notes here.
* The official textbook prepared by Sri. Akella Mallikarjuna Sharma, which contains Varnams, Kritis etc, for the whole 6 year course, is now available in English too. (Practical part only)
