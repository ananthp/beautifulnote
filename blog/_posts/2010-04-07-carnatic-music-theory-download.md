Note: It's from a copy of official syllabus, scanned & reformatted, however, I can't make any promises that this is the current and official syllabus. Shared in public interest.  

**UPDATE - Oct 5, 2012** : Uploaded Detailed Syllabus in Telugu.

**UPDATE - May 04, 2010** : Uploaded Year I Theory.

**UPDATE - Apr 22, 2010** : Broken link, fixed.

**UPDATE - Apr 9, 2010** : Corrected some mistakes in Year II.  (Vasantha - Avarohanam corrected, Hindolam is Audava ragam, Some notes about Thana and Padha varnams included.)

Notes:

I've completed my certificate course. I used a different strategy for my notes for year 3 and 4; I couldn't share the notes here. 

The official textbook prepared by Sri. Akella Mallikarjuna Sharma, which contains Varnams, Kritis etc, for the whole 6 year course, is now available in English too. (Practical part only)
