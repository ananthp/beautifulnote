I've created a library for Carnatic Music Notations. One can download Carnatic Music Notations/Scores for Varnams, Kritis from here. These notations are created by me and can be shared freely among carnatic music students, teachers and practicioners for non-commercial purposes.

### Background

Most of Carnatic compositions are out of copyright. Still 'scores' are quite difficult to find, except in actual printed books, which may be still under copyright. My objective is to provide beautifully typeset carnatic music notations that can be shared freely.

Moreover, creating carnatic music notations is a challenging task. Tools/Software for this purpose are rare and none of them is quite mature.Â  People use word processors, spreadsheets and some times plain text editors to score. I did my bit of exploration. I've come up with a system and workflow to produce beautiful carnatic music notations. If you are interested to learn to produce such scores/notations, ask me how.
