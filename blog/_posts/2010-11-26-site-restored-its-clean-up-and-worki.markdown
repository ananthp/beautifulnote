<p>Site Restored! It's clean, up and working fine.</p>
<p>Initially I thought it's the wordpress vulnerability. Started cleaningup the wordpress installation, .httrack, plugins and themes. Strangely, even if I rename&#47;move the actual wordpress folder, still the site continued to redirect to the spam site. </p>
<p>Figured out it must be some dns setting hack, I reset the dns zone settings, and viola, the site is up and running smooth. </p>
<p>Incidentally, I get an email from my host at exactly the same time saying "The malicious hacked pages on the site has been removed and redirecion to your blog has been restored. The site is appearing fine at our end. If you still see the hacked page, I would suggest you to clear your PC's cache and reload the site in the browser."</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure, whether I fixed it or the host.</p>
