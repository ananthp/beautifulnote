Added two varnam tables. 8 Adi Thala Varnams (from year 2, certificate
course, AP govt. music colleges).

- **Table 1** - Varnams first words, correspond raga, the mela ragam it's based on, and the name of its composer.
- **Table 2** - Number of avarthams in each section of the varnam (Anu Pallavi, Pallavi etc.) This is useful while playing second speed/Trisram etc.
