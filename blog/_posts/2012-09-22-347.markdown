  content: ! "Hi, \r\n\r\nThis is an awesome piece. Is it possible for you to share
    the carnatic notes for this? It would really help. I am an amateur player and
    would like to try this. Not sure if I will get it though. But would like to try.
    \r\n\r\nMy e-mail id - gayathri2879@yahoo.com\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\nGayathri"

<p>Su(r)li is my composition based on the etudes of carnatic music. It's an attempt to capture the mystical experience one gets when beginning to dwell deeper into music.</p>
