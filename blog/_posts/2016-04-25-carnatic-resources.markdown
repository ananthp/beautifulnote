### MusicResearch.in

[musicresearch.in](musicresearch.in) hosts some fine scholarly articles, scanned copies of rare books and manuscripts. It's not a very easy to use site but its contents are invaluable. Recently, they've spawned a new site [musicresearchlirary.net](musicresearchlibrary.net) and are moving rare books and manuscripts there along with some more content.
