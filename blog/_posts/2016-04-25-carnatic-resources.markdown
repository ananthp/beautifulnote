Stuff on carnatic music is not usually hard to come by. Nowadays, one can look up Arohana/Avarohana of a Raga or list of compositions by a composer with a quick web search. And then there are resources- massive, huge, immense resources- that serious students and researchers should be thankful that they exist online.

### Journal of The Music Academy

[Madras Music Academy](https://www.musicacademymadras.in/publications/journal) has been publishing this journal since pre-independence era. Many important musicians and musicologists have participated in this. [Journal archives](https://issuu.com/themusicacademy) from 1929 to 2002 are available online for free.

### MusicResearch.in

[musicresearch.in](musicresearch.in) hosts some fine scholarly articles, scanned copies of rare books and manuscripts. It's not a very easy to use site but its contents are invaluable. Recently, they've spawned a new site [musicresearchlirary.net](musicresearchlibrary.net) and are moving rare books and manuscripts there along with some more content.
