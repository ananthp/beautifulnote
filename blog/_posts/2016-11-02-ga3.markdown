In carnatic music, Anthara Gandharam (Ga<sub>3</sub>) has a peculiar characteristic. It can be heard clearly even when we play just Sa on tambura. It is a *Swayambu Swaram*, comes alive automatically due to the wonderful acoustics of tambura. This phenomenon is fundamentally important for carnatic music.

On a keyboard<sup>*</sup>, Major 3rd is used to approximate Ga<sub>3</sub>. However, Major 3rd (western music) is 400 cents<sup>#</sup> whereas proper carnatic Ga<sub>3</sub> is at 386.31 cents above Sa (5/4 ratio).
