Carnatic music has 16 swarasthanas packed in 12 distinct positions. The 12 tones are more or less universal; many systems of music around the world have them, may be with some differences in the ratios/frequencies of individual notes. (Checkout [Shruti Carnatic Tuner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kuyil.shruti) for precise swarasthanas used in Carnatic music)

In addition to the usual 12 notes, Carnatic music has 4 more swarasthanas, however they simply share their positions with existing notes. Sounds tricky? Not really, read on.

You can choose any frequency to be your *Sa*, the Shadjam, and all other swarams take their places based on your Sa. In practice you'll most likely choose one of the standard frequencies, defined by kattai/shruti/mane number, depending on whether you sing or play an instrument. For example, many male vocalists usually sing at 1 or 1½ kattai shruti, female vocalists 5½, instruments like veena, violin at around 3 kattai. When multiple musicians come together, a common shruti is chosen and instruments and voices adjusted to that. Again, experiment with Shruti Carnatic Tuner to get a practical understanding of how different katti shrutis work and what's suitable for you.

Your choice of *kattai* decides where your *Sa* is. Once *Sa* is decided, *Pa* also falls in place. So, swarams *Sa* and *Pa* each take one specific position (Swarasthana) and just stay there. The remaining swarams take multiple positions. There are two distinct varieties of *Ma*, so this swaram takes 2 swarasthanams.

The remaining swarams- *Ri, Ga, Dha* and *Ni*, take 3 positions each. Interestingly, there are overlaps between positions of *Ri* and *Ga*. Six swarasthanas (3 varieties each of *Ri* and *Ga*) occupy only four distinct places. Similarly, there are overlaps in *Dha* and *Ni* positions.

The fact that there are three varients each of *Ri, Ga, Dha* and *Ni*, and how exactly they overlap are key aspects of Carnatic music.  The entire 72 Melakartha Raga scheme is based on this. However, some books 'simplify' swarasthanams by omitting some overlapping swarasthanams and calling the remaining as "1 & 2" or "small & big". This is a terrible mistake and causes confusion especially in music notations.

The table [here](#table) lists out all 16 swarasthanams. Correctly numbered short forms are provided. You can also see how they are related. For example, Ri2 and Ga1 are listed in the same line. It means they have same pitch. What is the implication? That pitch will be treated as Ri in some ragas, and as Ga in some other ragas. 


Tips:

* In a raga, if both *Ri* and *Ga* are present, *Ga*'s pitch should be higher than *Ri*'s pitch. You can verify this by comparing the numbers. *Ga*'s number should be equivalent or higher than *Ri*'s. For example, Ri2 and Ga3 are valid combinations in a Carnatic raga, but Ri3 and Ga2 are not.

* In a raga where only either *Ri* or *Ga* is present, and you don't know whether to interpret a sound as Ri or Ga, it's most likely
    * Ri2 rather than Ga1
    * Ga2 rather than Ri3 

Of course, the same logic applies to *Dha* and *Ni*.

* If you are interested in Carnatic Swarasthanas, try [Sādhakam Carnatic Ear Trainer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kuyil.sadhakam) (android app). It trains you to recognize swarasthanas you hear. It works with all 16 swarasthanas as listed in the table, with correct numbers and short forms. Sādhakam only plays swarasthana combinations that are meaningful in Carnatic music and avoids all invalid combinations. See [this post]({{ site.base_url }}{% post_url /blog/2017-07-13-sadhakam-building-up-swara-gyanam %}) to know how Sādhakam app can help you to improve your swara gyānam.
