### Importance of this exercise

There are six valid combinations of <i>Ri</i> and <i>Ga</i> in Carnatic music (and very similarly there are six combinations of <i>Dha</i> and <i>Ni</i>). Cycles of <i>Ri</i>-<i>Ga</i> combinations and <i>Dha</i>-<i>Ni</i> combinations are the basis of the <i>72 Melakartha scheme</i>, which is one of the backbones of our raga system.

So, it is critical that every student masters these combinations.
