In Carnatic music there are seven musical notes, the *Sapta Swaras*. They are *Sa, Ri, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha* and *Ni*. In this series we'll take a look at each of these swarams, the pitch positions they take (*swara sthanam*s), and the relationships between them.

Pitch is something you would have already felt when singing. Some notes sound *low pitch* and some sound *high pitch*. There are fixed number of pitches. We are going to understand how these pitches are related to sapta swaras. We will also understand how these sapta swaras are related to each other.

The first swaram, *Sa*, is of great importance. It will be dealt in detail in another post. This post is about *Ri*. For now, it's suffice to know that all swarams fall in place based on the position of *Sa*. Let's move on.

*Rishabam* is the second swaram in our *Sapta Swaras*. It is abbreviated to *Ri*, or simply *r* in music notations. Note that *Ri* is right next to <!--more--> *Sa* in the sapta swaras sequence. So it has a pitch higher than *Sa* but pretty close to it. But what is the exact pitch of *Ri*? For that, we have to understand *swara sthanams*.

## Swara Sthanams

Each swaram in sapta swarams can be placed at specific pitch positions. These pitch positions are called *swara sthana*s. Some of the swarams belong to only one swara sthanam. For example, *Pa* has only one swara sthanam. However, there are swarams that have multiple swara sthanams. *Ri* is one such swaram. It has three swara sthanams. These are three consecutive pitches. When we say *Ri*, it can be one of the three pitch positions that belongs to *Ri*.

The first pitch position or *swara sthanam* of *Ri* is just a little higher in pitch than *Sa*. When you sing *Ri* at this pitch, it is called *Suddha* Rishabam, or shortly, *Ri1*. Suddha Rishabam occurs in ragas like *Mayamalava gowla* and *Saveri*.

The second swarasthanam of *Ri* is one step higher than *Suddha Rishabam*. It's called *Chatushruti Rishabam*, shortly *Ri2*. It occurs in ragas like *Mohanam*, *Sankarabaranam*, and *Kalyani*.

*Shatshruti Rishabam* (*Ri3*) is one more step higher. *Nata* is a popular ragam which has this swarasthanam.

It will help if you visualize *Ri1* on top of *Sa*, then *Ri2* on top of *Ri1*, and finally *Ri3* on top of *Ri2*.

## Mastering

Understanding the theoretical aspects is one thing, mastering the practical aspects is another. If you are a music student, you should learn to sing or play these swarasthanams accurately. You also need to learn to identify the swarams you hear.

Traditionally, as a music student you learn swarasthanams through *varisai* exercises (*sarali*, *janta*, etc). For instance, when you sing sarali in *Mayamalava gowla*, you are learning to sing *Ri1*. When you learn *Vara veena* geetham in *Mohanam*, you're learning to sing *Ri2*. However, changing from *Ri1* to *Ri2* is not sufficiently practiced. That's why you may have difficulty switching between ragams.

Try singing Mayamalava gowla for sometime, then immediately switch to Mohanam. You may have trouble switching from *Ri1* of Mayamalava gowla to *Ri2* of Mohanam. You may have the feeling that you're somehow stuck in Mayamalava gowla mood and struggle to get into Mohanam mood. Read <a {{ site.new_tab }} href="{% post_url blog/2017-07-13-sadhakam-building-up-swara-gnanam %}">this post</a> which elaborates on this.

In short, you need specific and focussed practice activities in order to master swara sthanams.

## Learning Activities

<a {{ site.new_tab }} href="{{ site.shruti_app_link }}">Shruti Carnatic Tuner</a> (Android app) detects the swarams you sing or play on instrument. It even shows your accuracy. It can also play reference sounds of swarasthanams to help you to align yourself to the swarasthanams better.

The following are the activities you can do with Shruti Carnatic Tuner to master *Ri*:

* Listen to *Ri1*, *Ri2*, and *Ri3* swarasthanams. Sing along. Are you able to hear the difference?
* Stop the reference sound and sing *Ri1*, *Ri2* and *Ri3* swarasthanams. Are you able to sing them perfectly?
* If you play an instrument, play the three swarasthanams of Rishabam. Are you able to play them accurately?

You may have noticed that it's difficult to switch between swarasthanams. Also, to beginners, all swarams sound the same; it requires some practice to know the difference between them.

<a {{ site.new_tab }} href="{{ site.sadhakam_app_link }}">Sadhakam</a> (Android app) helps you to improve your *swara gnanam*, so you just know the swaram and swarasthanam when you hear a sound. Do the first activity in Level 1 on Sadhakam, which works out the three swarasthanams of *Ri*.
